The movies that I emotionally connect with the most are those of simple humans stories of immense struggle with an emtionally meaningful ending. The ending itself need not neccesarily be happy as long as it clearly resolves the main characters' development throughout the movie. I've put a handful of my favorites below and want to talk a little bit about them

* **Minari**:
* **The Pursuit of Happyness**: This is definitely my favorite Will Smith movie (followed closely by the MIB series). This is a true story of a guy, Chris Gardner, . It also seems like Will Smith's performance was greatly aided by the fact that his son in the movie is also actually his son in real life as well.
* **Manchester by the Sea**:
* **Beautiful Boy**:
* **The Perks of Being a Wallflower**:
* **Marriage Story**:
* **Sound of Metal**:

The movies that I haven't seen yet that are of a similar vein are *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* and *If Beale Street Could Talk*.
