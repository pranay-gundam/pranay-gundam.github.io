There's this app called Beli that a lot of New Yorkers have. It's a food rating app where you log all the restaurants and rank their relative placements (whether or not you liked place A over place B); the app then assigns the rating number based on the number rating of the relative choices you made. It's a pretty good way of getting people to stay consistent with ranking restaurants because I feel like it takes a lot more effort to think of a number than to decide qualitatively if one place was better than than the other and turns the process into a small mini-game. I am, however, notoriously bad at logging every place I go to into the app, which leads me to forget about some places that I want to keep track of (especially when people ask me for recommendations). The solution perhaps lies in just writing about them here, so here are a few notable places over the past couple months.
