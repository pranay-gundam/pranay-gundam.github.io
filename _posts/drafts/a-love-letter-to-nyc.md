I came to nyc a skeptic. Growing up in a Dallas suburb makes one accustomed to a certain spacious life style and convenience of transportation by car. It's a feeling of supremacy that leads to statements like "I would never want to settle down in a big city like new york."

Now that I've moved out, however, I feel quite conflicted. I only lived in nyc for a grand total of 734 days, but I am now connected to it in a way that I would have never thought I would. I used to make fun of the common stereotype of people who move to the city and make wildly (word for feeling immature) claims about how they fell in love with the city and couldn't think of a life outside of it. While I definitely can imagine a life outside of nyc, I leave it with an impression of nyc being the ultimate city. It's as if most other cities I visit now have lost their luster and end up underwhelming. There's a big asterics next to every place I visit that says "this is no new york". Of course there are many pros and cons to living in nyc, but it is damn hard to find a place that checks the box of neighborhood identity as much as new york does

 (I've even made a past blog post before where I said I wasn't attached to the city because I couldn't romanticize it as much as Pittsburgh).

It's true that a cushy settled down life in nyc is very expensive but it is quite evocative for the dreamers like myself.

The delay in emotionally connecting to nyc came as a suprise to me because frankly, I love cities. I love the way you can look at another person's face and dream about all the experiences that they have gone through in their lives, I love the way that you can sit on a bench and try to reminisce about everything that has happened on that sidewalk over the past hundreds of years, and I love how you can (dream synonym) about the micro interactions between people and communities from the physical real-world ebbs and flows of a neighborhood.
