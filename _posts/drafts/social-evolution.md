As of the time I’m starting to write this (1/22/2025), I’ve just finished my first read of *1984* by George Orwell. Beyond thoroughly enjoying the book and rekindling my interest in the dystopian genre, I found that Orwell dedicated a significant portion of the text to discussing social movements—and particularly, how the social movement in the book managed to evolve away from the historical cycles of class struggle. I won’t spoil too much, but the gist of it is that social organization has historically always involved a lower, middle, and upper class, and the book explores how the upper class might hold onto power permanently.

As a quick diversion: every time I feel a renewed passion for a genre—like sci-fi last year—I feel compelled to dive deep into the books that either define or historically shaped that genre. Next on my list are *Animal Farm* by George Orwell, *We* by Yevgeny Zamyatin (which I’ve actually read before but want to revisit), *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley, and *Utopia* by Sir Thomas More. Also, I recently added a Goodreads social icon to the [about page](https://pranay-gundam.github.io/) of this website, so check that out if you want an idea of what I’ve been reading since 2024 (it’s not really accurate before then).

Back to 1984: all this philosophical discussion about social movements introduced ideas I hadn’t really thought about before. The use of the low-middle-high class divide as a framework for understanding social structures got me thinking more broadly about the relationship between wealth distributions and social organization. Economists generally believe that some level of inequality is beneficial. Of course, there are debates about the ideal level or structure of inequality, but very reductively, many of our models are built around the idea that different people have different levels of productivity. That is, their innate abilities and methods of contributing to society differ. Some models even include mechanisms where individuals can invest time and effort to improve their abilities.

The simple fact that a company chooses to hire Person A over Person B implies that they believe Person A can contribute more to the organization. This sort of choice underpins why inequality must be accounted for in economic models. From a societal progress perspective, the idea is that if we allocate more resources toward highly productive individuals, we can accelerate overall progress. Personally, I don’t think society’s goal should be just to progress as quickly as possible, but rather to do so ethically and sustainably—and I believe these two goals go hand in hand. A sustainable, ethical approach helps prevent frequent collapses. At the bottom of this post, I’ve attached a Jupyter Notebook that walks through some simulations I ran to explore these ideas.

Naturally, any discussion about inequality and differing productivity levels leads into the DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) conversation. If the goal is to build a more ideal or productive society, then I think it logically follows that some level of redistribution or equity-based programs are necessary—based on what I believe are very reasonable assumptions.

For instance, if we believe that the differences among humans across races and income groups are largely a result of environmental factors rather than genetic ones, then it follows that there is an equal distribution of productive potential across all demographic groups. To be clear, I’m not saying everyone is exactly the same, or that productivity manifests identically in everyone. Rather, I believe that the potential to contribute meaningfully to society is distributed equally across demographic groups.

If we fail to match this equal distribution of potential with an equal distribution of resources to help individuals actualize that latent potential, then society suffers an overall deadweight loss. Simply giving more resources to low-productivity individuals within a particular group doesn't serve society. Instead, resources should be allocated to individuals with latent potential, regardless of their current circumstances. From a purely capitalist perspective, resource allocation would ideally reflect this latent potential—but it’s not controversial to say that external, non-economic forces skew access to resources in a way that does not align with the actual distribution of productive potential across demographic groups. That misalignment is a clear source of capitalist inefficiency.
