As of the time that I am writing this (1/22/2025), I have just finished my first read of *1984* by George Orwell. Beyond thouroughly enjoying the book and reinvigorating my taste for the Dystopia genre, Orwell dedicated a significant portion of the text to talking about social movements and how the particular social movement of interest was able to evolve away from the social cycles of the past. I won't spoil too much but the gist was how social organization essentially always had a low, middle, and a high class and the discussion in the book was regarding how the high class could hold onto power permanently.

As a quick side note, everytime I feel a certain passion for some genre, like sci-fi last year, I feel the need to dive deep into the books either define the genre or are historically significant to the genre: next on the list are *We* by Yevgeny Zamyatin (which I actually already have read but want to reread), *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley, and *Utopia* by Sir Thomas More.

Back to *1984* now: all this philosophical discussion about social movements was something I hadn't thought about before but this use of the low-middle-high divide to classify social structures got me thinking more generally about the relationship to wealth distributions and social structures.
