I went to a Stephen Colbert recently (you can actually see me in a few of the audience shot), and all things considered it was quite the interesting experience. Everything is very streamlined (it makes sense given that they have a lot of practice with it) down to even the bathroom breaks, and they do a lot of encouraging to the audience to have big reactions to jokes or guests coming on stage which is something that I expected but being in the audience live does give you a difference sense of responsibility for enriching the experience of the TV audience.

Otherwise, it was a lot more political than I remember it being which in retrospect does make sense giving the upcoming presidential election. I didn't remember being this inundated with political content but I'm seeing it everywhere now, especially on youtube.

As an aside, I was rewatching Oppenheimer a couple weeks ago (which as another aside has taken the place for my favorite movie of all time which was a spot I could not definitely fill until Oppenheimer, I am truly so sad that I could not watch it in theaters) and realized how different the politicians seemed in that age than my perception of politicians now (on either side of the aisle to be honest). They just seemed so much smarter and calculated rather than just spouting random brazen comments all willy nilly. I feel the term career politician has been cast aside as a undesired trait in the past few election cycles but I think that there may be a shift back towards "the swamp" in the sense of the integlligence and an all round put togetherness of our candidates. I don't know too much about John McCain, but I've been seeing quite a few videos about him on my YouTube feed recently, and it reminded me of a different class of politicians who held high certain virtues which distance them from the current "Trumpism" effect.

It's interesting to me to see how old Republican politicians who have acted in very different ways have turned to embrace the new Trump-era tactics.

All this has brought me back to this day last year when I was thinking generally about politics and what the incentives that dictate the way politicians act as they do are. I did some thinking back then but never really arrived at something that motivated me to make a full-fledged post. Well, I've revisited the question now and have identified some clear levers that I think are in play. It took me a little bit, but I think I've been able to put something together in a neat way (in my opinion). So with that said, before I close off for you to get into the PDF (although I'm in Markdown now, doing the LaTeX separately for the most part is still much better), this topic will be a two-post series. Today I first talk about the model in depth this week and the motivation for it above, and next week I'll try to get my in-page Jupyter notebook feature working for you all to see some code to make some pretty visuals and see how one would solve this sort of question empirically.
