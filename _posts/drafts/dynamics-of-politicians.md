I went to a Stephen Colbert recently (you can actually see me in a few of the audience shot), and all things considered it was quite the interesting experience. Everything is very streamlined (it makes sense given that they have a lot of practice with it) down to even the bathroom breaks, and they do a lot of encouraging to the audience to have big reactions to jokes or guests coming on stage which is something that I expected but being in the audience live does give you a difference sense of responsibility for enriching the experience of the TV audience.

Otherwise, it was a lot more political than I remember it being which in retrospect does make sense giving the upcoming presidential election. I didn't remember being this inundated with political content but I'm seeing it everywhere now, especially on youtube (quite a lot of videos about John McCain interestingly enough).

All this has brought me back to this day last year when
