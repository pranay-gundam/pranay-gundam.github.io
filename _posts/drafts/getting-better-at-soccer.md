I've mentioned this on the blog before, but one of the best things about moving to NYC for me has been being able to play soccer again

- talk about how i used to play so scared and didn't have confidence
    - used to be scared when I had possesion of the ball about losing it
    - didn't connect socially with others
    - as a result didn't think about the game or practice outside of the bi-weekly practices

- soccer has been helping my mental
- talk about vision now and regaining confidence with blue lock
- talk about the current fed tournament and chemistry with rohan
