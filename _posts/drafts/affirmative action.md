I read this book on networks a while back called *The Human Network*. One of the main talking points was how the network effects on those in low-income areas can limit job and education opportunities. In the case of education, affirmative action for college acceptances has been a contentious issue. Their inherent purpose is to try to combat those network effects and there has been a decent amount of work in analyzing their effectiveness from both the econ and public policy perspective. I'm curious about the question from a modeling perspective such as in a lifecycle model context (after really quick and shallow google search I found one example [Ramos and Herskovic](https://ideas.repec.org/p/red/sed017/1552.html)).

The way I want to study it is in either some spatial or network context. As in how do local spillover effects in the network or local spatial area change when adding affirmative action.

There is a paper I had read for my NSF proposal called [The Impact of Racial Segregation on
College Attainment in Spatial Equilibrium](https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/more/2022-036) by Gregory, Kozlowski, and Rubinton that has very similar model features to what I am thinking.
