New HMPV, the media discourse about it, and how it compares to covid

There was this one game that I used to play as a kid in elementary school called plague where the player would take the perspective of the pathogen itself and try to evolve in a way as to infect the entire world, and part of the challenge of the game was that the governments of the world would enact policies in real-time to try to combat the spread of the pathogen. The one thing that has stuck with me this whole time about the game is the visual connection that the player can make between how their pathogen evolves or the enacted government policies to the real-time map of the spread of the disease itself, and I've always wanted to make something like this myself. This blog post is an excuse to do just that.
