The pressure between all the upcoming deadlines is really rearing its head now. I personally find it best to just set my mind to focus on one thing at a time; for example, during college I could just set out an order in which to do all the psets I have and just focus solely on each one until they are done, but I think that strategy does not bode well in a situation where I have to do my normal fed workstuff, NSF, GRE, etc. Its not the worst; just that I have to get really good at shifting modalities but I've been slowly getting better at it.

I did promise a follow up post of last weeks discussion of modeling politician decision making and that is still being cooked up but I have a few other things I need to focus on so that will have to be postponed for a later week. I did want to say though that there are quite a few addendum that need to be added to make sure I'm being satisfyingly enough accurate and descriptive.

In other things, this long weekend is quite well needed. I've been told that I usually say that even if I don't do much each weekend I actually do get around and I'll be finally going to a play (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child). This week I also finally managed to go to [Birdbox](https://birdbox.nyc/) and it is indeed quite good. It does not, however, take my spot as my favorite fried chicken sandwich. It is definitely number two, but the flavors in a Rowdy Rooster sandwich just hit differently (it's probably the Indian in me).

Short post this week since I'm grinding NSF and GRE prep. Until next week!
