One of the concept that shows up towards the end of the second book, The Dark Forest, and is discussed in a lot more detail in the third book, Death’s End, is the deterrence through mutually assured destruction or MAD.</p> <p>One quick tangent: I searched up what exactly the definition of MAD entails and although the definition of the terminology itself should apply, the term itself in the context of what it was made for applies specifically to mutually assured destruction through nuclear weapons with a first strike against a nation with second strike capabilities. So I’m not super sure if MAD the best term to describe what was happening in Death’s End since it was only one side threatening the destruction of both parties, in the book they call it simply “Dark Forest Deterrence” but for the sake of this post I’ll continue to call it MAD just because it does have logical parallels to the origin of the term (and also MAD is fewer characters to type out each time)</p> <p>In the book, the way MAD was threatened was through an “universal broadcast” that Earth could send out that included the located of the alien species’ star system and since humankind’s system and Trisolaris’ system were so close together that this would cause other alien species to discover the solar system as well. The reason why discovery was so scary was because this series ascribes to the “Dark Forest” explanation as to why alien civilizations were so hard to find: that all the surviving civilizations were very technologically advanced groups who distrusted every other civilization by default and operated under a “shoot on sight” protocol so broadcasting one’s location would get them immediately annihilated. In the case of Earth, this broadcast system was under control of a single individual. This, of course, was an immense responsibility since they were in control of the fate of two civilizations. So, in picking who that individual would be, one would have to make sure that it would be a person who would not activate the signal needlessly, but also give the impression that they would activate the signal when being attacked.</p> <p>This is a very similar issue to what the US had faced during the Cold War. Whenever I watch documentaries or listen to podcasts on the subject, they always talk about how there was so much research being done on this MAD-related game theory problem. For most of my life prior, I always thought that this was really silly given that my impression was that game theory was one of those simple 2x2 games. In retrospect now, I realize that to truly model the complexity of what is going on and include more nuances specific to the situation, you have to consider the exact mechanisms by which a MAD situation would be activated. Questions such as: who exactly has control of the launch, are they likely to retaliate even if they already know they are doomed, are there multiple people involved in the launching of nuclear weapons, how do you maximize the perception of one’s threat against their opponent without sacrificing other things? All these are questions that can be incorporated into a model that make the question a bit more interesting than one of those “2x2 Find the Nash Equilibria” games.</p> <p>I’ll detail one such model soon, but just for some context we can make to the archetypical 2x2 we see in high school Econ classes (note: that most of these changes are taken as part of a standard model in game theory in the literature, I’m not too read up on it so I may be missing a few key components):</p> <ul> <li>Tack on some functional structure for the probabilities that both the first and second strike of MAD are activated.</li> <li>Introduce multiple actions (with complete destruction being minus infinity utility). One can even make it an action that lies on some continuous domain instead of discrete choices.</li> <li>For games with sequential actions, we can represent the problem as nested games with each action taken further filtering the state spacetakes.</li> </ul> <p>With all that in mind, let’s try to construct a model for a Cold War-type situation between two world powers.</p> <iframe src="/assets/pdf/modeling-MAD.pdf" width="100%" height="1000px"></iframe>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="econ-thoughts"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note, Some spoilers for the Remembrance of Earth's Past series]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">reflections on macro I and monkeying around with OLGs</title><link href="https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2024/reflections-on-macros/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="reflections on macro I and monkeying around with OLGs"/><published>2024-02-03T13:28:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-03T13:28:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2024/reflections-on-macros</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2024/reflections-on-macros/"><![CDATA[<p>(Note: All of the text of this post was written on December 25th, 2023 while the attached pdf has been edited recently)</p> <p>I just finished a Macro Theory I at NYU with Sargent and Ljungqvist. Thankfully I ended up doing well but even more so than that I realized that I have a lot of interest in Macro. Maybe it was the different nature of taking only one class — which allowed me to focus on understanding only one subject thoroughly as opposed to five or six at the same time although I will say that working a job while taking a class is quite difficult — but being immersed in so much econ from class to all the work and seminars at the Fed was a different and enjoyable experience in terms of understanding and getting appreciation of the subject.</p> <p>I found myself naturally thinking about extensions of problems we discussed or how equilibriums would changed if we laxed certain assumptions (“extra thinking” that I would not do if I was in a class at CMU just struggling to keep up with all the course work) and having the time to actually work out examples myself as well. Very refreshing compared to the four year grind. The two topics of discussion that I have become intrigued with and will work on now before I have to focus on grad apps are structural modeling and just working out a few questions I had on OLG models and how they build out to the more involved macro models used on the frontier. I think I would probably be able to answer my questions with a few google searches leading to a handful of papers to read but it feels like a good exercise to put pen to paper and work it out myself.</p> <p>On that end I’ve attached some of the work that I wanted to look into after the class ended on OLGs (and a few of the other blog posts later will be on some of the structural toy models that I want to have in hand going into grad school).</p> <p>In other news, I will be taking Analysis II again at NYU this spring semester (and after that probably won’t take any more classes to focus on apps and other personal projects, although who knows may do Macro II next spring if they offer it) which I have heard is not as bad as analysis at CMU so we shall see how that goes in a few weeks.</p> <iframe src="/assets/pdf/OLG-Monkey.pdf" width="100%" height="1000px"></iframe>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="econ-thoughts"/><category term="personal-updates"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[(All of the text of this post was written on December 25th, 2023 while the attached pdf has been edited recently)]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What is all this?</title><link href="https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2023/What-is-all-this/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is all this?"/><published>2023-06-11T19:49:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-11T19:49:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2023/What-is-all-this</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2023/What-is-all-this/"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always heard about habit enforcement mechanisms: people posting videos of their workouts on social media, money bets that would make an individual lose money if they regressed to their bad habits, or even simple self rewards if an individual met a certain habit goal of theirs. I’ve never, however, really invested any time or effort into these so called “habit enforcement mechanisms” myself. There have been a lot of habits that I’ve genuinely wanted to adopt since basically middle school. A few of them have actually stuck but the fast majority have fallen to the wayside, so here I am trying something new. It’s interesting because I’ve always thought about writing a blog but I shudder at the thought of making my personal life public: posting something on the internet feels like a big commitment and this is more so the case when it is regarding issues related to who I am as a person. When you talk to a person face-to-face you get instant feedback about what it is you are saying and you are only talking to one person at one moment in time; things on the internet can reach any stranger at whatever moment in time. I don’t know if I’ve really related my thoughts in the right manner so far (I feel like when I write, it is in general a very disorganized stream of consciousness type of style) but tldr: I find posting things on the internet quite scary. This is especially the case after seeing a lot of well put together blogs written by people I really respect: classmates from high school and college, random people I’ve found on the internet, and others who are in places in their lives that I also want to be in.</p> <p>As such, the main purpose of this blog is not really some place to air out my intimate thoughts on stuff going on in my life (there might be a few scattered posts here and there, who really knows), but rather a sort of tracker of stuff I find interesting and talk about things I’ve learned that excite me.</p> <p>I’m about to head to NYC to start a two year long experience (as a research analyst on the DSGE team at the Federal Reserve) where I intend on learning as much as I can before applying to grad school. This blog is meant to keep track of my progress over at least these two coming years.</p> <p>P.S: Please do not roast me on anything related to grammar. I am sure there will be a lot of mistakes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal-updates"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always heard about habit enforcement mechanisms: people posting videos of their workouts on social media, money bets that would make an individual lose money if they regressed to their bad habits, or even simple self rewards if an individual met a certain habit goal of theirs.
