The number of oversights one makes when the only thing editing is an AI gives me a bit of hope that it won’t steal <em>all</em> of our jobs. There’s not anything neccesarily wrong per say with the model I discussed in part one but I really skimmed over some important details. First, the model I defined last in part one is a little bit different than the canonical job search question in that we have stochastic transitions and the politician’s choices affect this transition as well. Second, I definitely should have made the problems regarding the size of the policy space abundantly clear: I went for an ambitious model where the politician has a lot of choices of what they can do in each time, I’m trying to retain these choices but in doing so I have to sacrifice the extent to which the politican can consider each choice for the sake of having my code run in reasonable time.</p> <p>One other technique I forgot to mention (that I haven’t really seen in the econ literature/classes but is a pretty relevant method for reinforcement learning in ML) is Q-learning. This is a method that is very applicable in the scenario that I am discussing right now and I haven’t yet seen (although I am near positive that they exist) any problems in macro with stochastic transisions that depend on the action that the agent takes. In this case the politician’s transition probabilities into become elected in or “elected out” is itself dependent on both how much they spend on the elected and how they vote. For now, I did the value iteration by considering the expected value of the transition probability, but I’m also going to implement a Q-Learning thing as well just to see if they converge to the same value/policies (and for practice).</p> <div class="language-liquid highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{::nomarkdown}

The ending itself need not necessarily be happy as long as it clearly resolves the main characters’ development throughout the movie. I’ve put a handful of my favorites below and want to talk a little bit about each of them.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Minari</strong>: One of my favorite parts of this movie is the soundtrack <em>Jacob and the Stone</em> — it’s a masterpiece that captures the essence of the movie quite well by combining elements of childlike wonder amidst a prevailing undertone of nostalgic sadness. For some reason, the movie itself reminds me a lot of all the nature parts of <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> but involves a story of true American struggle.</li> <li><strong>The Pursuit of Happyness</strong> This is definitely my favorite Will Smith movie (followed closely by the <em>MIB</em> series). It’s a true story of a guy, Chris Gardner, who is going through tough financial times while trying to land a new job at a trading firm and taking care of his son by himself. The quintessential scene is at the end when Chris finally gets the job, and the audience understands how much it means to him given all the struggles he has endured to make it that far. It also seems like Will Smith’s performance was greatly aided by the fact that his son in the movie is also actually his son (Jaden) in real life.</li> <li><strong>Manchester by the Sea</strong>: This movie is what I call a masterclass in portraying “realistic grief.” Grief definitely manifests in very different ways for different people, but I personally think that the way Lee experiences his grief is very underrepresented in film — yet it reflects how a significant portion of people experience it. It doesn’t hit you when it “should” and does when it “shouldn’t.” It shows that healing doesn’t come in the form of momentous leaps at significant occasions like funerals but rather in small steps over time, like fishing trips with your nephew.</li> <li><strong>Beautiful Boy</strong>: The first time I watched this movie, I was emotionally moved for at least a week afterward. Even the thought of someone doing drugs made me inexplicably mopey and anxious because of what it did to the relationship between Timothée Chalamet’s character and his family. This movie and <em>The King</em> are what first made me start liking Timothée Chalamet, and I’m pretty eager to watch <em>A Complete Unknown</em> as well. Also, Steve Carell is a phenomenal dramatic actor (I admire comedic actors who can also excel in dramatic roles — like Robin Williams). One last thing I want to say about this movie is that it does a great job of showing the familial side of drug addiction.</li> <li><strong>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</strong>: It took me a while to get around to watching this movie (I only did a few months ago), but it’s definitely the one I can relate to the most. All the other movies on this list tell stories of people in vastly different physical or socioeconomic walks of life, but this movie is just the story of a high schooler in Pittsburgh. What I love most about this movie is that the foreshadowing was so subtle and that they didn’t show many of the trauma-inducing scenes on screen. Unbeknownst to me, this made the tension rise so gradually until it finally crescendoed with the music in the final breakdown scene, hitting like a truck. I still cry during that scene no matter how many times I’ve rewatched it. Plus, I love anything that has to do with Pittsburgh and feel an emotional connection to a lot of the places the friend group is also emotionally connected to — there are simply so many scenic places around the city that I’ve formed strong nostalgic bonds with.</li> <li><strong>Marriage Story</strong>: I knew this movie was all the rage when it first came out, and I actually tried to watch it but stopped 15 minutes in for some reason. It wasn’t until I revisited it during my senior year that I watched it the whole way through, and I didn’t regret it at all. Once again, the parts I enjoyed the most were the beginning and the ending — it tells a true human story that I’m sure many people have experienced. There’s no perfect happy ending, nor is it overly dramatized, but the movie keeps you engaged and emotionally connected the whole way through. Chef’s kiss.</li> <li><strong>Sound of Metal</strong>: The focus on sound in this movie was stellar, and the way it intertwined sound with Riz Ahmed’s character arc was masterful. I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did, but I connected deeply with the ending and thought it gave a new meaning to learning to accept one’s fate and making the best of it.</li> </ul> <p>The movies that I haven’t seen yet but feel are of a similar vein are <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> and <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> (there is this piece called <em>Agape</em> from <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> that I love so much — I deeply wish the entire movie is thematically exactly like this song).</p> <p>Finally, in other news, the Oscars are happening this Sunday, and I’m looking forward to watching them. I haven’t watched as many of the movies up for nomination as I usually do, but I did watch <em>The Brutalist</em> — which, on a side note, I loved the opening shots/scene from. I think it conveys the true elation that immigrants from difficult parts of the world felt when they landed in the U.S. — the true immigrant experience from back in the day that you hear fading anecdotes about nowadays.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal-updates"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The movies that I emotionally connect with the most are simple human stories of immense personal struggle with an emotionally meaningful ending.

As a high school student, I took the same view as the general public. I listened NPR in the mornings on the way to school where some “Senior Economist” from X company would qualitatively talk about the macroeconomics trends in some sector of the economy. During undergrad, however, a lot of my classes between math and cs were very quantitiatvely heavy and seemed to require deeper analysis than was found on the “Marketplace Morning Report”. It felt like there was a serious disconnect between the economics displayed in public and what I was experiencing myself in college. I had soon formed this idea that when people talk about macroeconomics in the news and in politics, it was using the tools of basic data analysis and the same coarse supply and demand graphs we studied in AP Macro and Micro; there was no sophisticated thought process underlying the intuition. This personal disastifaction with how imprecise I felt economics was handled even extented to the Federal Reserve and how Powell talked about why whatever rate decisions was being made. It felt like the important decisions were being made based on simple statements about how a price drop in thing A automatically implies that effect B occurs and I would cringe when I heard some econ commentary done by a non-economist that would not use the non-technical jargon that I had gotten used to. There did not seem to be many statements about the non-linear interactions economists think exist between all the different components of the economy or all the complex ways agents in our modeling process simultaneously solve their own optimization problems. I’ve since changed my view about how economics is communicated to an extent (which I will talk about shortly), but I still feel as if this divide is the quintessential issue in the relationship between public distrust and academia. I’ve been digging through the weeds that is the medical research on diet and personal health over the past year so I am well aware of the same divide in other academic fields, but I know both tranches of econ a lot more than other fields so I can speak to that better.</p> <p>Economics is obviously a hot button topic in politics because most everyone has to deal with money in some context and relies on it for their livelihood. People care about economic policy a lot but political ideologies about what is the right economic policy is very split. Among economists, however, my personal experience has been that people are not as much split along political lines as they are academic ideology wise when it comes to the actual economics that they are doing. To me, the academic ideology doesn’t seem to have as many direct links to the political divide as people consider it to have either. I feel like the perception of economists is that they look at graphs all day long and try to come up with some qualitative justifcation to explain why some lines go up and others don’t, which can be very suscpetible to one’s political views, when in reality there is a sophisticated machinery, that when explained step-by-step does seem to to be logically tractable to most people, behind the scenes. I’m not a complete optimist in that I know some groups are already completely entrenched in their beliefs, and at the end of the day, I don’t think that the divide will ever completely dissapear but I’m sure we can get in a better place than we are in right now. Relative to a field like medicin or quantum physics, there are many ways to contextualize the complexities in econ in an approchable manner and the topics are things that mostly do have a tangible impact that is easy to point out.</p> <p>On the other hand, I have now also come to develop a respect towards the way economics is communicated. I think it takes a special skill to be able to be aware of all the intricate dynamics at play and focus on the important factors or summarize this immensly complex network of relationships in a few sentences. Its something I defintely am not able to do well right now, but I am slowly getting there. I respect a lot of the economists here at the NY FED (and other big names who are good at communicating to outside of the academia bubble) since having started working here, but I still have my own additional ideas of how to better communicate ideas to help bridge the gap between polarized sides.</p> <p>I personally want to develop this communication skill as well. I’ve gotten a lot of feedback about how, for readers who are not in econ, the full econ themed blog posts really seem to lose them. Although I definitely won’t stop writing those types of posts (since those posts are the actual reason why I had an urge to write out my thoughts in blog format in the first place), I do want to put out more posts that try to bridge the gap between the economics that I interact with on a daily basis and something more easily understood by someone not in econ in a way where the rigour of the underlying analysis is communicated well. To know that when I say I think “The changes in thing A causes effect B”, it is understood that my reasoning is drawn out from a lot more than a few sentences of qualitative logic.</p> <p>As a final disclaimer, all this is not to say that econ doesn’t have its problems with inherently biased work. Yes, there are assumptions that have to be made to make the math/statistics work. Yes, there are many choices about why a model is built one way or the other. Yes, not every paper is constructed over the same dataset and the choice of which data to use in itself introduced bias. But in my personal experience, the rational for these decisions that must be made aren’t often related to political partisan lines. My main point is to say that I don’t think that economics is as strictly partisan in academia, and therefore people should not be as distrusting of opinions that do not align with themselves, as people consider it to be. It is very true that I am not the definitive voice of what goes on in all parts of academia, but I definitely do have a lot of restored faith in the Fed relative to my thoughts as an undergraduate student.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="econ-thoughts"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my mind, there is a big divide from the economics that I interact with on a daily basis and what the average american considers to be economics.

It’s a food rating app where you can log all the restaurants and rank their relative placements (whether or not you liked place A over place B); the app then assigns a rating number based on the number rating of the relative choices you made. In general, I think it’s a pretty good way of getting people to stay consistent with ranking restaurants because I feel like it takes a lot more effort to think of a number than to decide qualitatively if one place was better than another and turns the process into a small mini-game. I am, however, notoriously bad at logging every place I go to into the app, which leads me to forget about some places that I genuinely want to keep track of (especially when people ask me for recommendations). The solution perhaps lies in just writing about them here, so here are a few notable places I’ve been to over the past couple months.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>l’artusi</strong>: For some reason, I had heard somewhere that this place was very overated and had that sense walking into the restaurant as well. I am (and Anouska for that matter), however, a sucker for both ricotta and buratta and our first app (which was a burrata crostone with fig and some other accoutrements) completely swayed me away from my preconceived notions about the place. There’s something about these middle to high upscale italian restaurants that deeply resonates with me; I feel like they really capture what I consider is the essence of italian cuisine, simple high-quality ingredients with very precise and intentional preparation. I’m not remembering every dish that we got from here but another famous dish of theirs that is a must have is their cacio e pepe. I eventually did rate this on my Beli and it’s pretty high up there.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lucali</strong>: After months of thinking that I was going to go here, I finally made it and it is worth the hype by far. To be blatantly honest, I’ve seen pictures of the pizza before and didn’t think all too much about it, but both seeing it in person and tasting it is a completely different world. I’ve never had a New York style slice with this texture and it stands far above everybody else when it comes to this: the dough is unbelievably light while also maintaining incredible crisp. They are very particular with toppings and only offer a small list of eight-ish or so toppings. My favorite combo was surprisingly mushrooms and sweet pepper as opposed to the shallots and garlic. I still need to go another time to try the other items on their menu, the calzone and the rotating pasta that they change up but Lucali definitely makes it hard to choose my favorite pizza place between itself and L’Industrie Pizzeria (all these l’ places have something going on). At the end of the day it’s a battle between texture and flavor. All I can say definitely is that a pizza place with the texture of Lucali and the flavor creativity of L’Industrie would rule the world of New York Style slices. The next pizza place I have in my sights is Una Pizza Napoletana.</p> </li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Oct-Nov-Dec%20Food%20Post/Lucali-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Oct-Nov-Dec%20Food%20Post/Lucali-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Oct-Nov-Dec%20Food%20Post/Lucali-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Oct-Nov-Dec%20Food%20Post/Lucali.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The shallot garlic pizza </div> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Oxomoco</strong>: I’ve always felt like I’ve been to a michelin star restaurant in NYC, but other than a pastry popup from Eleven Madision Park, I cannot remember having been to another before Oxocomo. If that’s the case then Oxomoco is officially the first michelin star restaurant that I’ve been to (it has one star). It wasn’t mind blowing by any means but it was damn good food. We actually got two appetizers for free (due to some small hair in the tortilla chip), the guac n’ chips and the salsa n’ chips, both of which have given me some inspiration for when making my own guac and salsa. The main star of the show that I hard heard about were the tacos. I don’t think the brunch menu has all their tacos but I thoroughly enjoyed the ones I tried: the beet taco and the lamb barbacoa taco. I could speak a lot more about both in detail but the main idea takeaway is that Oxomoco does very well at finding a theme for each of their tacos and designing a well-rounded taste/presentation experience around them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyderabadi Zaiqa</strong>: You wouldn’t expect it but Hyderbadi Zaiqa actually shows up on a decent number of “best in nyc” lists. I actually wasn’t the most hungry and in a eating state of mind when I came here so I don’t think our group ordered as optimally as we could have. I want to go again and make sure I’m treating this place the same as all the others, but out of what I did have, it was pretty decent.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Radio Bakery</strong>: It feels like ages since I’ve first visited Radio Bakery so I’m surprised that I haven’t talked about it yet. It may be the best bakery I have been to in NYC (with Dominique Ansel and Little Flower Cafe being a close contenders below) and it’s where I’ve had my favorite Pain au Chocolate (this is something that I try at each bakery that I go to if they have it). They don’t skimp on the chocolate at all on this croissant, it’s like a solid block of goodness surrounded by a perfect croissant, truly divine. They are also pretty popular for their foccacia sandwhiches which are also both very unique and quite well crafted. I’ve also bought a whole wheat sourdough loaf from them as well and made a couple sandwiches with it. I’m addicted to this place (even though I’ve only been twice).</p> </li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Oct-Nov-Dec%20Food%20Post/Radio%20Bakery-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Oct-Nov-Dec%20Food%20Post/Radio%20Bakery-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Oct-Nov-Dec%20Food%20Post/Radio%20Bakery-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Oct-Nov-Dec%20Food%20Post/Radio%20Bakery.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Foccacia Sandwiches </div> <ul> <li><strong>GupShup</strong>: I am recently been going on a crusade to find a upscale indian restaurant that blows my mind and GupShup was one of those on the list to try.

It’s a food rating app where you can log all the restaurants and rank their relative placements (whether or not you liked place A over place B); the app then assigns a rating number based on the number rating of the relative choices you made. In general, I think it’s a pretty good way of getting people to stay consistent with ranking restaurants because I feel like it takes a lot more effort to think of a number than to decide qualitatively if one place was better than another and turns the process into a small mini-game. I am, however, notoriously bad at logging every place I go to into the app, which leads me to forget about some places that I genuinely want to keep track of (especially when people ask me for recommendations). The solution perhaps lies in just writing about them here, so here are a few notable places I’ve been to over the past couple months.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">finally back (post grad apps)</title><link href="https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2024/finally-back/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="finally back (post grad apps)"/><published>2024-12-16T08:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-16T08:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2024/finally-back</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pranay-gundam.github.io/blog/2024/finally-back/"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a while since my last post, mostly due to PhD applications and a big project going on at work, both of which have now pretty much ended which means we are getting back to the regularly scheduled weekly posts and boy do I have a lot in my drafts. This week, I just wanted to talk about random tid-bits here and there from the past two-ish months.</p> <p>Something that is most recent in my mind is a conversation I had with some friends who are not american citizens. One of them has already gotten picked in the H1B visa lottery but the other is still trying and we were observing how it felt like there was some innate country of origin bias in the process; either each country has their own lottery system or somehow immigrants from certain countries have better chances than others. Probability can be pretty deceiving, however, because based on how you define “feeling that an immigrant from one country has better chances than an immigrant from another country”, this statement and each immigrant having completely equal and independent chances can both be true. The example I had thought about was take a case where I know two australians and ten singaporeans all applying for an H1B visa and realistically each one has a 5% chance of getting chosen. It’s far more likely that at least 50% of my australian friends (aka one person) gets chosen than at least 50% of my singaporean friends getting chosen (aka five people) since you only need at least one australian to get selected but five singaporeans. If this percent of total population is the way you think about the probability of an australian getting an H1B vs a singaporean getting and H1B then even though the actual chance is the same because this country based definition depends on the immigrant population sizes from each country. You can also get pretty specific with the actual probabilities but I don’t feel like latexing the work for that all out right now other than saying if there are two countries with immigrant populations \(x, y\) where \(x&lt; y\) trying to get an H1B visa and the probability of any one person getting the visa in the lottery is \(p &lt; 0.5\). The chance of country X and country Y getting \(50\%\) of their population winning the lottery is \(\binom{x}{0.5x}p^{0.5x}(1-p)^{(1-0.5)x}\) and \(\binom{y}{0.5y}p^{0.5y}(1-p)^{(1-0.5)y}\) respectively (for the uninitiated, the \(\binom{x}{y}\) just means all the ways you can make groups of size \(y\) out of a total number of \(x\) many things). I’m being a little imprecise here for the sake of interpretability but two big caveats: this is all of course assuming that these country’s population sizes don’t have that much of an effect on the individual probability of winning the lottery, and I’m also assuming that both \(0.5x\) and \(0.5y\) are whole numbers. Long story short, the objective probability versus the way humans look at the world are quite different.</p> <p>In other news, I’m finally restarting a few projects that have been on hiatus for a while. Two of them are some video game ideas that I’ve had. The first, will take a bit of time and is a small dungeon crawl, but the second is a recreation of a small mobile game called “Landing Confirmed”. The concept behind this game is very simple, you have to navigate a rocket around a series of obstacles but the main draw is that the rocket is very fragile so colliding with any obstacle results in having to restart the level. The means by which you control the movement of the rocket, however, is the main draw for me. It’s a bit difficult to get used to but once you get a hang of it, the movement is so intuitive and leaves so much room for skill expression that gives the game a lot of potential. These game concepts and the feeling of mastering the mechanics are hard to explain to non-gamers but all you need to know is that the game is really satisfying to play and master. You essentially control the rocket by clicking on either the left or right side of the screen to control the left and right boosters respectively. The boosters contribute to both rotational and positional acceleration the same way an actual rocket would work. There is no nonsense letting you move horizontally on command, you have to first angle the rocket properly and then push with both boosters (except there is some more nuance in that obviously if you angle a rocket completely horizontally, or generally the more horizontal the axis of movement, the more speed you need to keep the rocket up right to avoid falling, but if you are trying to navigate through a set of obstacles then you need to manage your angles of travel and speed very accurately to avoid crashing).</p> <p>I’m not sure how far I’ll take my version of the game. I was thinking about some online multiplayer type shebang but we’ll see how I feel as I make progress. I do know that at the very least I want to create a basic version with one level and a rocket and match the feeling of the physics in the game. Regardless, you can find the current stage it is in <a href="https://github.com/pranay-gundam/landing-confirmed-engine">here</a>.</p> <p>There was a lot more that I wanted to talk about but not gonna lie I am completely blanking on everything. So in the spirit of not procrastinating I’m just going to shoot this one off. Next week is a food post (which I have been told are some of my more popular ones)!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal-updates"/><category term="miscellaneous-math-fun"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been a while since my last post, mostly due to PhD applications and a big project going on at work, both of which have now pretty much ended which means we are getting back to the regularly scheduled weekly posts and boy do I have a lot in my drafts.

I had a conversation with work friend last week about CAPTCHA and RECAPTCHA, you know I had to pull the CMU flex and talk about how the guy who made that was a CMU professor and how they managed to make hella money off of it from the New York Times, and the conversation strayed into the general realm of bot detection. He was telling me how for some of the new Google bot detection stuff they track the movement of your cursor when you go to interact with whatever puzzle they give you. The very basic main idea is that humans don’t move in perfect straight lines and “botters” (if that is indeed the adjective to describe them, maybe botists or botmens/botwomans/botpeople) are sometimes too lazy to bother making the cursor move in some more nuanced way. At a higher level even if the botter were to make the cursor move in curves there is still a mathematical difference between a perfect curve and imperfect ones.</p> <p>This got me thinking about strategies to make the cursor move in a nonbotlike manner. After doing more research later, I also found out that the speed of one’s cursor at different parts of the path is also a big tell in differentiating between a persion and a bot. Specifically a human tends to move the cursor faster the further they are from the target and then make smaller slower micro adjustments the closer they get. I tried paying attention to my mouse movements for a bit and saw that the “strategy” I used was also dependent on the size and position of the target. Meaning my approach curve and speed was not independent of the position and also very dependent on the size. For example, when I want to manually click on a tab to switch to on chrome, I tend to move the cursor very fast with disregard for vertical precision because there’s no such thing as vertically overshooting a target that is already at border of the screen. In another case, when I’m not conscioulsy aware of where my cursor is positioned initially, I will move the cursor directly horizontal or directly vertical until I visually see where it is and then error correct respectively. At it’s core, I feel like human behavior is all about iterative error correction which reminds me a lot of stochastic gradient descent.</p> <p>I’ll talk about a few methods that came to mind in order of simple to most complicated but ultimately from my qualitative view of how I personally move the cursor, I think the key to acting like a human is to act “stochastically predictable”.</p> <p><strong>1. Straight line movement</strong> This is pretty simple to understand, there is a target pixel at coordinates \((x_T,y_T)\) and the cursor starts at coordinates \((x_0, y_0)\). We then draw a simple line between the two points and move the cursor at some speed (or variable speed). Specifically, we choose some time unit \(t'\) we want the total travel time of the cursor to be and some update frequency \(s'\) (meaning every \(s'\) milliseconds we update the position of the cursor). This means that at the i-th update of the cursor, it is at the coordinates \(\left(i\cdot\frac{s'(x_T - x_0)}{t'}, i\cdot\frac{s'(y_T - y_0)}{t'}\right)\). We can pull some other shenanigans too with changing the speed of the cursor the closer we get to the target and I’ll show the math for that too now itself when the curve math is simple. I’m not super sure how other people do this but my first thought when considering variable speed is writing some dynamics for velocity or acceleration. One simple case is with constant acceleration \(a'\) so that velocity decreases at a constant rate. In the last constant velocity case the velocity vector was \(\left(\frac{s'(x_T - x_0)}{t'},\frac{s'(y_T - y_0)}{t'}\right)\) and in this case we need to determine some initial velocity \((v_{0,x}, v_{0,y})\) and can write the position of the cursor at the i-th update as \((x_0 + i\cdot v_{0,x} + \frac{1}{2}\cdot i^2\cdot \frac{2(x_T - x_0 - v_{0,x}t')}{t'^2}, y_0 + i\cdot v_{0,y} + \frac{1}{2}\cdot i^2\cdot \frac{2(y_T - y_0 - v_{0,y}t')}{t'^2})\). In general though, I don’t think that people move with constant acceleration so it’s probably wise to have some sort of stochastic principle for this acceleration term at each timestep.</p> <p><strong>2. Moving in a sequence of straight lines</strong> Think of this like the more discrete and fine tuned version of moving in a direct line. There are basically two approached, either you write some specific algorithmic manner of diverging away from the target or you do it stochastically but still make sure the path converges to the target. In actual practice, I think there are a few ways one can do this. The first that comes to mind is at each update step to draw a direct line from the current position to the target and place and have some predetermined idea for what percentage of the of the way the cursor will travel based on which i-th update step one is on. Then we preturb this i-th step target coordinate stochastically somehow or even preturb the angle of approach by drawing the pertubations from some distribution with mean zero.</p> <p>The final issue to consider here is the issue of speed. Since we discretize the steps, choosing a different constant speed for each step that decreases the closer we are to the target makes and this simulates having some acceleration. Then again, we can do a similar thing as above and be a bit more random than that.</p> <p>The one issue that I can preemptively see from this approach is cases where you never reach the target or generally taking too far steps away from the target leading to convergence towards the target way too late. People don’t generally overshoot or diverge from their target a crazy amount. Handling this will definitely require some level of calibration of how much randomness should be in the process but I also think it would be wise to make the randomness decrease the closer the cursor is to the target.</p> <p><strong>3. Moving in curves</strong> This is basically the same concept as the previous case except you move in a curve instead of a series of straight lines. There is some math principle called Bézier curves to draw such curves which also happens to be a process that one can imbue a lot of randomness into.</p> <p><strong>4. Considering human behavior</strong> I mentioned a few behaviors above that I personally tend to have when moving my mouse and I think it would make sense to incorporate this into the bot’s movement as well somehow. I would definitely need more data to figure out other tendencies but put simply all we are doing is making the speed and approach dependent on the size and actual position of the target as well.</p> <p><strong>5. The ML perspective</strong> At the end of the day, there is also the approach of throwing everything into some ML model with a bunch of examples of human made and robot made curves and speeds.</p> <p>All this is interesting to talk about from a ideation perspective but I feel like making some animations or seeing the cursor actually move would be much cooler. It’s a type of project that I am really interested to do for the sake of making something cool but not sure when I’ll get the time. This type of stuff reminds me of what Shane from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StuffMadeHere">Stuff Made Here</a> does; he gets to work on all these cool projects that one would not usually be able to with a unrelated job.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="miscelaneous-math-fun"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently on a bus to DC for the weekend and have gotten tired on working on econ things for now so here I am talking about this.

The closest I’ve got to a perfect trip was just a few weeks ago where my flight got delayed by 15 mins, but everything else has been by either a couple hours or has been a cancellation. For one of my originally planned trip to Dallas, my flight there got canceled and I never got to catch any other flight to Dallas that weekend because of all the people whose flights got canceled and were then on the stand-by list (there were basically around 100 per flight).</p> <p>This happens to me now mostly because I’m flying from NYC (as opposed to Pittsburgh where the only time I’ve ever had an issue was once when I was flying to … you guessed it, NYC). Specifically, NYC (and Atlanta for that matter) are such big airports in terms of air traffic and interconnectivity with other airports that a small weather delay on one side of the country has drastic ripple effects in NYC since there are missing planes or crews. Maybe I’ve just been at the brunt of a lot of bad luck and we can’t design these airport systems any better but perhaps there’s an interesting question here about how we can do better. Sure there are some unavoidable situations, such as a city being inherently desirable to travel but there are factors that we can control such as how many resources to dedicate to a specific airport or whether or not to connect two airports by a flight path.</p> <p>I’ll go more in detail about how we’ll be representing airline traffic networks and the optimization process in a post in the future but to be able to do the optimization we need to make sure we have a well-defined problem. Specifically, we need some framework of characteristics that are <em>good</em> and a way to classify one traffic network as being better than another. This is by no means an exhaustive list but here are some characteristics that I’ve thought of.</p> <ul> <li>Network A is better than Network B if it costs less.</li> <li>Network A is better than Network B if the closing of one or more airports affects fewer flight routes or flight traffic.</li> <li>Network A is better than Network B if the average flight path duration is less.</li> </ul> <p>To be able to claim a best network, we have to also come up with some relative weightage for how much we value one of these characteristics over another. I’m not going to make any sort of claim on this here just because that gets into more normative questions about which of the above are more important than the others.</p> <p>On one hand, the question of optimizing this network is indeed interesting but I’m also curious about what is the worst that we can do. What would the worst case air traffic network look like? In this case to make sure there is a well-defined problem to solve, we have to also craft a unitary definition for the worst network or a class of <em>bad</em> characteristics and find networks that have all of them. We can consider it to just be the opposite of the <em>good</em> characteristics above, but I’m sure there is another classification that might make more sense based on how we mathematically portray these airline traffic networks. At one edge case it could be a network where no node is connected to another but I don’t think that really qualifies as a legitimate air traffic network so we would also have to apply more restrictions such as ensuring that there is at least one path from each node of the network to another. One other design that I initially think of that could be maximally bad is one where there is one mega airport that connects to every other airport and no other airports have any other connections between eachother. This way, a weather event in the central airport would disrupt travel everywhere, but then again I’m not sure if this is the objective worst.</p> <p>This post is only part one because I did not have the time to fully flesh out the pdf that I wanted to type out. There might be some code in the future there as well although I have no idea how I’m going to have the time generally.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="econ-thoughts"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been so unlucky with my flights this year; I haven’t had a trip yet where one of the flights wasn’t either delayed or canceled.
