  abstract={We document the real-time forecasting performance for output and inflation of the New York Fed dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model since 2011. We find the DSGE's accuracy to be comparable to that of private forecasters before COVID but somewhat worse thereafter.},

  title={New York Fed Working Paper: Tradeoffs for the Poor, Divine Coincidence for the Rich.},
  author={Marco Del Negro and Ibrahima Diagne and Keshav Dogra and Pranay Gundam and Donggyu Lee and Brian Pacula},
  abstract={We use an estimated medium-scale HANK model to investigate how the tradeoff between stabilizing inflation and consumption volatility varies for households with different levels of wealth. Consumption for the rich is mostly affected by demand shocks via their exposure to highly procyclical profits-for them, stabilizing consumption and inflation coincide. The poor are more vulnerable to supply shocks, hence aggressively stabilizing inflation is costly in terms of their consumption volatility. While they dislike inflation because it erodes real wages, they are hurt even more by an aggressive monetary policy response to inflation, which reduces real wages further while increasing unemployment.},
