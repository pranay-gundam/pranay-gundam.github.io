Iâ€™m currently a first year PhD student at the University of Minnesota. My economic research interests lie in macroeconomics with particular interests in trade, monetary policy, and computational methods. I find that I learn best by coding stuff up so take a look at my github for projects on any of the topics above.

Previously I worked on the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) team; as part of the group I lead the ongoing development of ModelConstructors.jl, SMC.jl, and DSGE.jl, which are open source packages that build, estimate, and forecast DSGE models respectively.I also graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2023 with a dual degree: a B.S. in Economics & Mathematical Sciences and a B.S. in Computational Finance. 

Outside of my academic interests I enjoy soccer, cooking, and any anything related to sci-fi. Check out my blog for my thoughts on econ, food, and other things going on in my life!
